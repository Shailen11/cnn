            <p id="modem">Modem <br>
              Modem is a device that enables a computer to send or receive data over telephone or cable lines. The data stored on the computer is digital whereas a telephone line or cable wire can transmit only analog data. <br><br>
              Simplex − A simplex modem can transfer data in only one direction, from digital device to network (modulator) or network to digital device (demodulator). <br><br>

              Half duplex − A half-duplex modem has the capacity to transfer data in both the directions but only one at a time.<br><br>

              
              Full duplex − A full duplex modem can transmit data in both the directions simultaneously.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p id="hub">HUb <br>
              Hub –  A hub is basically a multiport repeater. A hub connects multiple wires coming from different branches, for example, the connector in star topology which connects different stations. Hubs cannot filter data, so data packets are sent to all connected devices.  In other words, the collision domain of all hosts connected through Hub remains one.  Also, they do not have the intelligence to find out the best path for data packets which leads to inefficiencies and wastage. <br><br>
              Active Hub:- These are the hubs that have their own power supply and can clean, boost, and relay the signal along with the network. It serves both as a repeater as well as a wiring center. These are used to extend the maximum distance between nodes.<br><br>

              Passive Hub :- These are the hubs that collect wiring from nodes and power supply from the active hub. These hubs relay signals onto the network without cleaning and boosting them and can’t be used to extend the distance between nodes.<br><br>

              
              Intelligent Hub :- It works like active hubs and includes remote management capabilities. They also provide flexible data rates to network devices. It also enables an administrator to monitor the traffic passing through the hub and to configure each port in the hub.</p>

            <p id="repeater">Repeater <br>
              Repeater – A repeater operates at the physical layer. Its job is to regenerate the signal over the same network before the signal becomes too weak or corrupted so as to extend the length to which the signal can be transmitted over the same network. An important point to be noted about repeaters is that they do not amplify the signal. When the signal becomes weak, they copy the signal bit by bit and regenerate it at the original strength. It is a 2 port device. </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p id="switch">Switch <br>
              Switch – A switch is a multiport bridge with a buffer and a design that can boost its efficiency(a large number of ports imply less traffic) and performance. A switch is a data link layer device. The switch can perform error checking before forwarding data, which makes it very efficient as it does not forward packets that have errors and forward good packets selectively to the correct port only.  In other words, the switch divides the collision domain of hosts, but broadcast domain remains the same. </p>
